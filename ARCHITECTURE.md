> * **Location Context:** "Target deployment: Queensland, Australia. Prioritize Australian fauna (Possums, Wallabies) over US species."
> * **Physical Constraints:** "Primary camera monitors a workshop access pathway 8,500 mm long. Target animals may appear small/distant."
> * **Infrastructure:** "Host: Windows VM on Proxmox with NVIDIA GPU passthrough. Service: Windows Service via NSSM."
> * **The Logic:** "Use a Dual-AI Waterfall: Blue Onyx (Fast/General)  SpeciesNet (Deep/Specialist)."
